Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, Material-UI for UI components.
Backend: SpringBoot ,MySQL database
Additional Libraries: Axios for HTTP requests
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd college-online-voting-system
Install dependencies: npm install
Set up the backend: Follow instructions in the backend/README.md file.
Start the frontend: npm start
Usage
Ensure the backend server is running.
Access the application in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.
Use appropriate login credentials (admin/voter) to access the respective dashboards.
Cast votes (for voters) or manage elections (for admins) as per the assigned role.
Future Improvements
Implement additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication.
Enhance data analytics features to provide deeper insights into voting patterns.
Improve user experience by refining the UI/UX elements.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
